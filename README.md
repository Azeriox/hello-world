Hello , Time is the fourth dimension and a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future,and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time has long been a major subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring system. Some simple, relatively uncontroversial definitions of time include "time is what clocks measure" and "time is what keeps everything from happening at once"

Time is only experienced by the reactions it was once created by.
We now have more reactions in 10 years then we had in 3 billion years of evolution. I believe connecting people with common interests will resolve the cruel problems our society has been creating for the past 200 years.
It is time to make a change and in this project every single person can be part of this change!

Share your thoughts, share your experiences, it does not matter what the experience is as long as it teaches you new lessons in life.

Kind regards,

Jeremy te Hoonte
